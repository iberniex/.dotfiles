## Ingredients

1. [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) (Iterm2:before)
2. Neovim
3. zsh - [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
4. Tmux - [Oh-my-tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux), [Dracula/tmux](https://github.com/dracula/tmux)
5. Kitty - as a brew package. Trust.

## Recipe

1. Get a Mac for the first time while being caged in Windows for a while (for legal reasons this is a joke).
2. Start of with a normal terminal for some time.
3. Then some [Mac guru](https://github.com/mosesokemwa) tells you to use [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) and stop being weird.
4. Customize that isht like you own everything (you don't).

   - You start increasing your typing speed to like 75 wpm and above

5. Start using neovim cause you like mental games and stuff(no vscode hate).
6. Start learning Lua and for some reason you are into C and Rust.
7. Get into note taking tools like zettelkasten so markdown is the wave.
8. Start liking GPU rendering but Iterm doesn't want you to use it in Tmux.
9. Start using Ghostty and start liking and you find is a really fast Terminal Emulator and has [kitty Graphics Protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/)
10. Serve it while hot.
